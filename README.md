# Lambda Calc

Lambda Calculus parser written in haskell.

## Parser

Currently the parser is quite simple and will parse a straight lambda
calculus, however, the goal is to extend that to a larger and more
verbose lambda calculus.

## Evaluation

Multiple ways of evaluating will also be implemented.
